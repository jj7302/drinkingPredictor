# drinkingPredictor
A program which takes various information about students, including their name, age, school, family status, absences, grades, and more to predict how often they are to drink based on a Lasso Regression on historical data. Lasso implemented with scikit learn uses L1 regularization and a grid search done to optimize model parameters. student-mat.csv includes the data being worked with for this model, Model Summary.png includes information about the model and attributes of each student being included, and drinkingPredictor.py contains the python code.
